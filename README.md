ICT Academie Web Site
=====================
This repository contains both the code and the content for the web site of the ICT Academie (part of Da Vinci College in Dordrecht, The Netherlands).

Local development on Windows
----------------------------
Since this web site uses PHP, you need something like WAMP or USBWebserver to develop locally. The contents of the src-folder in the repository should go to your wwwroot- or root-folder locally. You can do this either by checking out only the src-folder or by checking out the entire repository and creating a symbolic link to your local src-folder which replaces the wwwroot- or root-folder.
